### Social Distancing Application

In this fun project (Social distance Detection) , I am using YOLO (You only look once) + weights and COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset for identifying person in real-time video.

- [Yolo V3](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf)
- [COCO labels](https://github.com/amikelive/coco-labels)
- Distance : Euclidean (between boxes)

We can create the same concept in our workplace and maintain social distancing.

Inspiration
This home project is inspired from Sir Andrew Ng's startup

### Face Mask detector using Opencv , keras , CNN
Fun/Hobby project on Real-time face mask detector during quarantine period ðŸ˜Š. It can be enhanced a lot and can be integrated with Mobile app (Pythonista) , Raspeberry Pi (Miniconda3) , etc and can be utilized in many ways.

Details
- Python - 3.6.5 | Conda - 4.8.3 | Keras and Tf
- Algorithm - MTCNN (Multi-Task Convolution Neural Network) - Lot to learn !!
- Activation function - RELU (Rectified Linear Unit) for hidden layers
- Optimizer - Adam optimizer

### Detect eye movement and control mouse pointer (without touching mouse pad)
Last year December holidays , I was reading various articles , papers , blogs on Human Computer Interaction . With all those techniques / papers , came up with small project.

Project : Detect eye movement and control mouse pointer (without touching mouse pad)

### Object detection using OpenCV and CNN
Yolo - You Only Look Once
This is an interesting topic of detecting objects in picture or video [in real time] (and is becoming very popular).
Yolo is extremely fast and outperforms detection methods like DPM and RCNN. Interestingly , YOLO performs detecting objects using single neural network.

A simple Python application is created to detect objects in image (using Opencv library ) to experiment the model (images below)
