      <description>Comparison of Spark streaming , Structured streaming and Kafka Streams   What is a Watermark? Its a method to hande the lateness. Basically , it can be regarded as threshold to specify how long system wait before data arrives. If the event falls under the watermark interval , then the event&amp;rsquo;s data is utilized for computation else the event&amp;rsquo;s data is dropped for that time interval.
Unsupported Operations in Structured Spark streaming  Multiple streaming aggregations are not yet supported on streaming Datasets.</description>

      <description>Spark Streaming DStreams (Discretized Streams)  It is an abstraction provided by Spark streaming It is basically represents series of RDD     Directory monitoring (dataDirectory) is described here
Window Operations Spark provides window operation which helps to perform transformation on sliding window    Window length - The duration of the window Sliding interval - The interval at which the window operation is performed  Example of window operation # Reduce last 30 seconds of data, every 10 seconds windowedWordCounts = pairs.</description>

      <description>Spark Memory and Optimizer Optimizer   Core of Spark SQL has Catalyst optimizer which leverages 2 important Scala features
 Pattern matching Quasi Notes (Easy to generate code at runtime from composable expressions)    Catalyst supports both rule-based and cost-based optimization.
  Designed for 2 main pruposes :
 Easily add new optimization techniques and features to Spark SQL Enable external developers to extend the optimizer (e.</description>

      <description>Install Spark For Windows : Please follow this site
Basics of Spark Flow Run Spark application -&amp;gt; Driver program starts -&amp;gt; Main function starts -&amp;gt; SparkContext gets initiated -&amp;gt; Driver program runs the operations inside the executors on worker nodes. SparkContext uses Py4J to launch a JVM and creates a JavaSparkContext. By default, PySpark has SparkContext available as ‘sc’, so creating a new SparkContext won&amp;rsquo;t work.
Serialization and Deserialization Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.</description>

      <description>Time Complexity Big-O , Big-Omega , Big-Theta
 Big-O is the upper asymptotic bound for an algorithm . Worst-case scenarios Big-Omega is the lower bound asymptotic bound of an algorithm. Bast-case sceanrio Big-Theta is in between lower and upper asymptotic bound (tight bound) of an algorithm. Average or expected case scenario  Space Complexity Amount of memory or space required by an algorithm
In recursive calls counts,the code would take 0 (n) time and O( n) space.</description>
