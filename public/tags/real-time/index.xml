      <description>Kafka Architecture   Kafka uses ZooKeeper to manage the cluster.
  ZooKeeper is used to coordinate the brokers/cluster topology.
  ZooKeeper gets used for leadership election for Broker Topic Partition Leaders.
  Kafka producers write to Topics -&amp;gt; Kafka consumers read from Topics.
  Topic is associated with a log which is data structure on disk. Kafka appends records from a producer(s) to the end of a topic log.</description>

Pub-sub model Messaging infrastructure is based on subscription based model (Active MQ)
Event streaming model Events are written into logs. Consumers need not require to subscribe event - rather they can be read or join from any part of the stream (Kafka)
