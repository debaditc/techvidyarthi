      <description>Comparison of Spark streaming , Structured streaming and Kafka Streams   What is a Watermark? Its a method to hande the lateness. Basically , it can be regarded as threshold to specify how long system wait before data arrives. If the event falls under the watermark interval , then the event&amp;rsquo;s data is utilized for computation else the event&amp;rsquo;s data is dropped for that time interval.
Unsupported Operations in Structured Spark streaming  Multiple streaming aggregations are not yet supported on streaming Datasets.</description>

      <description>Spark Streaming DStreams (Discretized Streams)  It is an abstraction provided by Spark streaming It is basically represents series of RDD     Directory monitoring (dataDirectory) is described here
Window Operations Spark provides window operation which helps to perform transformation on sliding window    Window length - The duration of the window Sliding interval - The interval at which the window operation is performed  Example of window operation # Reduce last 30 seconds of data, every 10 seconds windowedWordCounts = pairs.</description>

      <description>Kafka Architecture   Kafka uses ZooKeeper to manage the cluster.
  ZooKeeper is used to coordinate the brokers/cluster topology.
  ZooKeeper gets used for leadership election for Broker Topic Partition Leaders.
  Kafka producers write to Topics -&amp;gt; Kafka consumers read from Topics.
  Topic is associated with a log which is data structure on disk. Kafka appends records from a producer(s) to the end of a topic log.</description>
