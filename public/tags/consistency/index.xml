      <description>About CAP Theorem It is also known as Brewer&amp;rsquo;s theorem after computer scientist Eric Brewer
Simple terms It states no distributed data store can provide more than 2 out of 3 gurantees
  Consistency : Every client views the same data. Every node in distributed cluster recieves same data.
  Availability : During node failure time, every node must respond in a reasonable amount of time.
  Partition tolerance : Gurantees partition tolerance can recover from partitions once the partition heals.</description>

      <description>Eventual Consistent  Mainly used in NoSQL databases (Solr, Cassandra , MongoDb) Used for analytics , time series analysis , etc Low latency - Faster writes    Please follow Werner Voggel&amp;rsquo;s blog - here
Strongly Consistent  Mainly used in RDBMS like Oracle , MySQL , PostgreSQL Primarily used in banking and payment systems High latency - Slower writes    Please read about F1 database by Google here Photo Credits : Google Blog</description>
