      <description>About OSI Model OSI stands for Open System Interconnection Model enables syetems to communicate using standard protocols. It is based on 7 layers . During my college days, I used to remeber it as &amp;ldquo;PDN-T-SPA&amp;rdquo; which is Physical , Data , Network , Transport , Session , Presentation and Application layer.
  Comparing OSI Model Layer with TCP/IP model   </description>

      <description>In my last tech blog, I discussed on Decision trees and Random Forrest. So I thought of articulating on Gradient Boosting model and XgBoost. But before these algorithms , its important to understand 2 basic concepts :
 Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation) Boosting  Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation) Bootstrapping is a process of creating random samples with replacement for estimating sample statistics. With replacement means , the sample might have duplicated values from the original set.</description>

      <description>Social Distancing Application In this fun project (Social distance Detection) , I am using YOLO (You only look once) + weights and COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset for identifying person in real-time video.
 Yolo V3 COCO labels Distance : Euclidean (between boxes)  We can create the same concept in our workplace and maintain social distancing.
Inspiration This home project is inspired from Sir Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s startup More details are here</description>
