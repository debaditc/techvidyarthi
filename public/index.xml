      <description>Time Complexity Big-O , Big-Omega , Big-Theta
 Big-O is the upper asymptotic bound for an algorithm . Worst-case scenarios Big-Omega is the lower bound asymptotic bound of an algorithm. Bast-case sceanrio Big-Theta is in between lower and upper asymptotic bound (tight bound) of an algorithm. Average or expected case scenario  Space Complexity Amount of memory or space required by an algorithm
In recursive calls counts,the code would take 0 (n) time and O( n) space.</description>

      <description>Comparison of Spark streaming , Structured streaming and Kafka Streams   What is a Watermark? Its a method to hande the lateness. Basically , it can be regarded as threshold to specify how long system wait before data arrives. If the event falls under the watermark interval , then the event&amp;rsquo;s data is utilized for computation else the event&amp;rsquo;s data is dropped for that time interval.
Unsupported Operations in Structured Spark streaming  Multiple streaming aggregations are not yet supported on streaming Datasets.</description>

      <description>Install Spark For Windows : Please follow this site
Basics of Spark Flow Run Spark application -&amp;gt; Driver program starts -&amp;gt; Main function starts -&amp;gt; SparkContext gets initiated -&amp;gt; Driver program runs the operations inside the executors on worker nodes. SparkContext uses Py4J to launch a JVM and creates a JavaSparkContext. By default, PySpark has SparkContext available as ‘sc’, so creating a new SparkContext won&amp;rsquo;t work.
Serialization and Deserialization Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.</description>

      <description>About CAP Theorem It is also known as Brewer&amp;rsquo;s theorem after computer scientist Eric Brewer
Simple terms It states no distributed data store can provide more than 2 out of 3 gurantees
  Consistency : Every client views the same data. Every node in distributed cluster recieves same data.
  Availability : During node failure time, every node must respond in a reasonable amount of time.
  Partition tolerance : Gurantees partition tolerance can recover from partitions once the partition heals.</description>

      <description>Simple definition Process of making paritions of data in database
Vertical and Horizontal Sharding Let us understand using simple example
Table   Veritical Sharding   Horizontal Sharding Sharding is performed on the basis of salary.
 Horizontal Shard1 = salary &amp;lt; 100000 Horizontal Shard2 = salary &amp;gt; 100000 AND salary &amp;lt; 250000 Horizontal Shard3 = salary &amp;gt; 250000    Benefits of Sharding  Improves the efficiency of queries Sharding results to small logical table which makes query faster Read and write performance increases  Problems with Sharding  Joining data across shards is expensive process as the join happens across the network Too many shards is a problem and increase the overhead  What happens the shard fails ?</description>

      <description>Kafka Architecture   Kafka uses ZooKeeper to manage the cluster.
  ZooKeeper is used to coordinate the brokers/cluster topology.
  ZooKeeper gets used for leadership election for Broker Topic Partition Leaders.
  Kafka producers write to Topics -&amp;gt; Kafka consumers read from Topics.
  Topic is associated with a log which is data structure on disk. Kafka appends records from a producer(s) to the end of a topic log.</description>

      <description>Nutshell  Horizontal scaling means that we scale by adding more machines into pool of resources Vertical scaling means that we scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.  High level difference   Real world implementation Take the benfits of both Horizontal and Vertical scaling
 Vertical scaling : Inter process communication and data consistency Horizontal scaling : Scalability and Resilient (no single point of failure)  Ideal way - First have the veritical scaling (optimal level) and scale horizontally.</description>

      <description>Trees are well-known as a non-linear data structure. They don’t store data in a linear way. They organize data hierarchically.
A tree is a collection of entities called nodes. Nodes are connected by edges. Each node contains a value or data, and it may or may not have a child node.
The Image at the beginning of the article (Source) explains the terminologies of a Tree.

      <description>About Word2Vec algorithm  Word2Vec is not a single algorithm Word2vec is a group of related models that are used to produce word embedding&amp;rsquo;s. These models are two-layer neural networks that are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words. Word2vec takes large corpus of text as its input and produces a vector-space, with each unique word in the corpus being assigned a corresponding vector in the space.  Word2Vec can utilize either of 2 model architectures –  CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words) Skip Gram    CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words) The input to the model could be wi−2,wi−1,wi+1,wi+2wi−2,wi−1,wi+1,wi+2, the preceding and following words of the current word we are at.</description>
